# Governance

## Purpose

This document describes how **LibreCourseUY** is organized, how decisions are made, and how community-wide rules and responsibilities are managed.

Its goal is to keep the project open, practical, and sustainable without adding unnecessary bureaucracy.

This document complements, but does not replace:

* `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
* `CLA.md`
* `TRADEMARK.md`
* repository-specific documentation

---

## 1. Community Character

LibreCourseUY is an **independent, community-driven, non-institutional open source community**.

It exists to support the creation, maintenance, and dissemination of open resources, tools, and knowledge for the public good.

LibreCourseUY is open to contributions from the general public, including students, educators, developers, maintainers, and other interested participants.

---

## 2. Governance Principles

LibreCourseUY aims to operate according to the following principles:

* **Openness** — contributions, discussion, and reuse should be encouraged whenever compatible with the project's goals
* **Clarity** — decisions should be understandable and documented when relevant
* **Respect** — collaboration must remain constructive and sustainable
* **Practicality** — governance should help the project move forward, not slow it down unnecessarily
* **Accountability** — people making decisions should be able to explain them
* **Project protection** — maintainers may act to protect the project's technical quality, community health, legal safety, and non-institutional character

## 3. Roles

### 3.1 Contributors

Contributors are people who participate in the project by:

* opening issues
* submitting pull requests
* improving documentation
* reporting bugs
* proposing ideas
* helping with review, moderation, or community support

Contributors are expected to follow the project's community and contribution rules.

### 3.2 Maintainers

Maintainers are people with responsibility for one or more repositories, spaces, or community processes.

Maintainers may:

* review and merge pull requests
* close or prioritize issues
* request changes
* enforce repository standards
* moderate discussions
* manage releases, repository settings, templates, and policies
* act on legal, technical, branding, or safety concerns affecting the project

Maintainers are expected to use these powers reasonably and in good faith.

### 3.3 Organization Administrators

Organization administrators are maintainers with broader responsibility over the LibreCourseUY organization itself.

They may:

* manage organization-wide settings
* define or update default community-health files
* create or archive repositories
* appoint or remove maintainers
* respond to cross-repository disputes
* act on project-wide legal, security, identity, or governance issues

---

## 4. How Decisions Are Made

Whenever possible, decisions should be made through **open discussion and rough consensus**.

In practice:

* small or routine decisions may be made directly by the relevant maintainer
* repository-specific decisions should usually be made by the maintainers of that repository
* organization-wide decisions should be discussed by organization administrators and other relevant maintainers when appropriate

Consensus is preferred, but unanimity is not required.

When no consensus is reached in a reasonable time, the relevant maintainer or administrator may make a decision and document it when useful.

---

## 5. Scope of Maintainer Authority

Maintainers may make day-to-day decisions about:

* pull requests
* issues
* releases
* code quality
* repository structure
* documentation
* moderation in repository spaces
* technical direction within the scope of the repository

Maintainers may reject contributions that are:

* out of scope
* low quality
* legally risky
* misleading as to authorship or official status
* incompatible with repository standards
* harmful to the project's sustainability or community health

---

## 6. Organization-Wide Policies

Some rules apply across LibreCourseUY as a whole.

These may include:

* `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
* organization-wide issue and PR templates
* security reporting guidance
* support guidance
* community identity and trademark policies

Where GitHub or another hosting platform supports organization-wide defaults, those defaults are intended to provide a consistent baseline across repositories.

---

## 7. Repository Autonomy and Overrides

Each repository may define additional local rules, documentation, and workflows suited to its technical needs.

Repository-specific files may supplement organization-wide defaults, provided they do not contradict core project-wide rules on:

* conduct
* legal contribution requirements
* identity and anti-confusion protections
* security-sensitive handling
* organization governance decisions

If there is a conflict between a repository-specific document and a project-wide governance or legal policy, the maintainers and administrators may determine which rule controls in context.

As a general rule:

* repository-specific files control day-to-day technical workflow
* organization-wide files control shared community standards and cross-project protections

---

## 8. Becoming a Maintainer

There is no automatic right to become a maintainer.

New maintainers may be appointed based on factors such as:

* sustained quality contributions
* good judgment
* reliability
* technical familiarity with the relevant repository
* respectful collaboration
* alignment with the project's goals and community standards

Appointment may be made by the current maintainers of a repository, organization administrators, or both, depending on the scope of responsibility involved.

---

## 9. Removal or Change of Maintainer Status

Maintainer or administrative access may be changed or removed when reasonably necessary, including for reasons such as:

* prolonged inactivity
* misuse of permissions
* repeated poor judgment
* violation of project policies
* harmful conduct
* security concerns
* organizational restructuring
* repository transfer, archival, or re-scoping

Such changes do not require public dispute or blame. They may be made as a practical governance measure to protect the project.

---

## 10. Disputes and Escalation

Most disagreements should first be handled in the most local and practical place possible:

1. the relevant issue, pull request, or discussion
2. the maintainers of the affected repository
3. organization administrators, if escalation is needed

Escalation may be appropriate when there is a serious dispute involving:

* governance
* moderation
* contributor treatment
* repository ownership
* security concerns
* legal risk
* branding or institutional confusion
* abuse of permissions

The project is not required to host endless or repetitive disputes. Maintainers and administrators may close discussions once a reasonable decision has been made.

---

## 11. Transparency and Decision Notes

Not every decision requires a formal record.

However, maintainers and administrators are encouraged to document decisions when they are:

* cross-repository
* likely to affect contributors significantly
* likely to be revisited later
* governance-related
* security-sensitive, after any required confidentiality period
* relevant to branding, naming, or institutional-risk mitigation

Documentation may take the form of:

* an issue
* a discussion thread
* release notes
* a changelog entry
* a policy update
* or another practical written record

---

## 12. Emergency Authority

In urgent situations, maintainers or administrators may act immediately to protect the project, its contributors, or the public.

This may include action relating to:

* security incidents
* credential leaks
* malicious code
* legal threats
* impersonation
* institutional-confusion risks
* harassment or community safety issues
* abuse of project infrastructure

When appropriate, a follow-up explanation may be provided after the immediate risk has been addressed.

---

## 13. Relationship with Institutions

LibreCourseUY is not an official institutional body.

Participation by students, staff, researchers, or other institution-affiliated individuals does **not** by itself make LibreCourseUY part of that institution.

No contributor, maintainer, or administrator may claim institutional endorsement, official representation, or formal authority on behalf of any institution unless such authority has been expressly verified and documented.

---

## 14. Changes to Governance

This document may be updated as the community evolves.

Changes may be proposed through the project's normal discussion channels and may be adopted by the relevant maintainers or organization administrators.

Major governance changes should, when practical, be communicated clearly to the community.

---

## 15. Final Practical Rule

LibreCourseUY aims to stay **open, useful, community-driven, and non-institutional**.

When this document leaves room for interpretation, it should be read in the way that best preserves:

* the health of the community
* the sustainability of the project
* the clarity of responsibility
* the quality of the work
* and the project's independent character
