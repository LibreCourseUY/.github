# Contributing to LibreCourseUY

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **LibreCourseUY**.

LibreCourseUY is an open community that builds and maintains useful public-interest resources under open-source and open-knowledge principles. We welcome contributions from students, teachers, developers, researchers, and the general public.

## Before you start

Please read these files before contributing:

- `CLA.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `TRADEMARK.md`
- `SECURITY.md` (for vulnerability reporting)

## Good first contributions

You do not need to write code to help.

Good contributions include:

- bug fixes;
- documentation improvements;
- translations;
- accessibility improvements;
- tests;
- small UI improvements;
- issue triage;
- data cleanup;
- better examples; and
- well-scoped feature proposals.

If you are new, start with something small and reviewable.

## How to contribute

1. Check whether an issue or discussion already exists.
2. If the change is large, open an issue or discussion first.
3. Fork the repository and create a focused branch.
4. Keep the change small, readable, and easy to review.
5. Update docs and tests when relevant.
6. Open a pull request with enough context for a reviewer to understand the change.

## What maintainers look for

We usually merge contributions that are:

- clearly explained;
- within the project's scope;
- legally safe to accept;
- consistent with the repository's style and architecture;
- documented when necessary; and
- respectful of LibreCourseUY's community-led and non-institutional nature.

## Pull request checklist

Before opening a pull request, make sure that:

- you have the right to submit the content;
- the change is focused and not unnecessarily broad;
- documentation is updated if behavior changes;
- tests were added or updated if relevant;
- the title and description are clear; and
- you are ready to accept review feedback.

If the project requires signed commits or CLA confirmation, complete those steps too.

## Things to avoid

Please do not:

- submit content you do not have rights to share;
- add institutional logos, seals, or branding without permission;
- present the project as official, endorsed, or institutionally backed when it is not;
- mix unrelated refactors into a small bug fix;
- open very large PRs without prior discussion; or
- introduce licenses that conflict with the repository's stated license.

## Issues and feature requests

Good issues are specific, reproducible, and polite.

When reporting a bug, include:

- what you expected;
- what happened instead;
- steps to reproduce;
- screenshots or logs if useful; and
- your environment when relevant.

When proposing a feature, explain:

- the problem;
- why it matters;
- the expected behavior; and
- whether you want to implement it.

## Review and maintainer discretion

Opening a pull request does not guarantee merge.

Maintainers may request changes, ask clarifying questions, delay a decision, or reject contributions that are out of scope, unsafe, legally unclear, misleading, or too costly to maintain.

## Need help?

If you are unsure whether an idea fits, open a discussion or draft pull request early. It is better to align first than to spend time on a large change that does not match the project's direction.

Thank you for helping build LibreCourseUY.
