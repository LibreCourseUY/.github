# Code of Conduct

## Our community

LibreCourseUY is an open, public-interest community. We want it to be welcoming, constructive, and safe for contributors, maintainers, and users.

This Code of Conduct applies to project spaces and to public interactions when someone is officially representing LibreCourseUY.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment include:

- being respectful and constructive;
- assuming good faith while still being honest and direct;
- giving and receiving feedback professionally;
- focusing criticism on ideas, code, and process rather than people;
- crediting the work of others;
- being transparent about authorship, sources, and limitations; and
- helping keep the project open, useful, and non-misleading.

## Unacceptable behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- harassment, intimidation, or threats;
- hateful or discriminatory conduct;
- personal attacks, insults, or sustained hostility;
- sexualized language or unwanted sexual attention;
- doxxing or sharing private information without consent;
- impersonation or deliberate deception;
- spam, disruption, or bad-faith participation;
- knowingly submitting illegal, confidential, or unauthorized material; and
- using LibreCourseUY spaces or identity in a way that falsely suggests official institutional backing.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in:

- repositories;
- issues;
- pull requests;
- discussions;
- documentation sites;
- chat spaces officially run by the project; and
- public spaces when someone is acting as an official project representative.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct.

They may take any action they consider appropriate and proportionate, including:

- asking for a change in behavior;
- editing or removing content;
- closing discussions or pull requests;
- rejecting contributions;
- muting or suspending participation; or
- banning repeat or severe offenders.

## Reporting

Report Code of Conduct problems to **conduct@librecourseuy.org**.

Before publishing, replace that address with a real contact that at least two trusted maintainers can access.

When possible, include:

- what happened;
- where it happened;
- links or screenshots;
- who was involved; and
- whether there is an immediate safety concern.

Maintainers will review reports in good faith and try to handle them as discreetly as reasonably possible.

This document works alongside:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
