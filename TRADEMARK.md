# Trademark and Identity Policy

## Purpose

This policy explains how the name, branding, and identity of **LibreCourseUY** may and may not be used.

Its goals are simple:

- avoid confusion;
- protect the project's reputation;
- preserve the community-led identity of the project; and
- reduce legal and institutional risk.

## Core rule

You may refer to LibreCourseUY truthfully.

You may **not** present something as an official LibreCourseUY channel, release, partnership, or institutionally backed project when it is not.

## No institutional affiliation

LibreCourseUY is an independent community project.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing, LibreCourseUY is **not** officially affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or acting on behalf of any university, faculty, government body, or private institution.

## What this policy covers

This policy applies to the use of:

- the name **LibreCourseUY**;
- organization and repository names;
- logos, icons, and visual identity;
- website and social branding;
- public-facing project descriptions; and
- any branding that could cause confusion about origin, endorsement, or official status.

## Allowed uses

These uses are generally allowed as long as they are truthful and non-confusing:

- referring to the project by name;
- linking to the project;
- saying that you contributed to the project;
- discussing, reviewing, or teaching about the project;
- creating a compatible tool or integration that accurately describes the relationship; and
- forking the code under the repository's open-source license.

## Uses that require caution or permission

Please ask first before using the project name or branding in:

- event branding;
- merchandise;
- fundraising or sponsorship materials;
- social media accounts that look official;
- institutional communications;
- services or products with visible project branding; or
- collaborations that imply endorsement.

## Prohibited uses without permission

Do not, without explicit permission:

- use the project's logo or visual identity in a way that suggests official status;
- register confusingly similar domains, accounts, or organization names;
- claim that your fork, site, or service is the official project when it is not;
- imply that LibreCourseUY is institutionally certified, endorsed, or authorized when it is not; or
- use third-party institutional logos, seals, or branding inside the project without permission.

## Forks and derivatives

Forking the code is allowed under the repository's license, but that does not automatically give you the right to keep the same branding in a way that causes confusion.

If you publish a fork or derivative, make it clear that it is your version unless you have permission to present it otherwise.

## Maintainer actions

To reduce confusion or risk, maintainers may request changes to branding, naming, descriptions, assets, or public presentations connected to the project.

That can include renaming repositories, removing logos, rejecting misleading contributions, or rebranding official assets.

## Questions

If you are unsure whether a use is acceptable, ask the maintainers before publishing it.
